        <p> Miles winds up finding out a bunch of truths in this latest adventure, mainly having to do with “canon events” that connect through every Spider-person across various Earths. Our hero’s dad (Brian Tyree Henry) is about to be promoted to police captain and is going to die as part of Miles’ canon, and when Miles wants to stop it from happening, he draws the ire of Spider Society leader Miguel O’Hara (Oscar Isaac). That’s not all: It turns out that Miles isn’t even supposed to be a Spider-Man: He was bitten by a radioactive spider (another canon event!) that was from a different Earth than his own.
       </p> 
       <p>
        The youngster escapes Miguel’s clutches and teleports home to save his father using Spider Society technology, but he’s sent to Earth 42 instead of his own Earth 1610 – since the Spider-scanner shows his biology has been affected by that pesky spider bite. Miles discovers his father is already dead there instead of his uncle, Aaron Davis (Mahershala Ali), the criminal known as the Prowler who was murdered in "Into the Spider-Verse." And when Miles runs into Aaron in this different world, he learns the hard way in the “Across the Spider-Verse” climax that the villainous Prowler of this Earth isn’t Aaron – it’s Miles.
